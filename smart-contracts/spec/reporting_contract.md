# Smart Contract Specification: `Reporting.sol`

## 1. Overview

The `Reporting.sol` smart contract is the core operational component of the decentralized local governance framework. It acts as an immutable, transparent ledger for the entire lifecycle of civic issue reports.

### 1.1. Application Flow (Backend Orchestration)

The complete flow for submitting a civic report follows this exact sequence:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. ReportingController Receives Request                      │
│    - Receives: description, image, mockProof, nullifierHash  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. Send to AiOracleService for Approval                     │
│    - Validates: content moderation, spam detection         │
│    - Returns: isApproved (boolean), reason (string)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓               ↓
            isApproved: true    isApproved: false
                    ↓               ↓
        ┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐
        │ CONTINUE         │  │ REJECT           │
        │ (proceed to 3)   │  │ (throw error)    │
        └──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘
                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 3. Send to IpfsService for Storage                          │
│    - Uploads: description, image, metadata                  │
│    - Returns: IPFS CID (cryptographic hash)                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 4. Send IPFS Hash to BlockchainService                      │
│    - Calls: submitReportToChain(ipfsCID, nullifierHash)    │
│    - Submits transaction to Reporting.sol contract          │
│    - Returns: transactionHash, blockNumber                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 5. Return Success Response to Client                        │
│    - Returns: message, transactionHash, blockNumber         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Critical Invariant:** AI Oracle approval MUST occur BEFORE IPFS upload. A report is never stored on IPFS or submitted to the blockchain without prior AI moderation clearance.

Its primary responsibilities are:

1. **Secure Record Keeping:** Storing the cryptographic links to off-chain report data (stored on IPFS) and linking them to privacy-preserving unique identifiers (ZKP Nullifiers).
   - Reports are ONLY recorded on-chain after: (1) AI Oracle approval, (2) IPFS storage, and (3) Relayer submission.
   
2. **State Management:** Enforcing a strict Finite State Machine (FSM) that dictates how a report moves from submission to validation, investigation, resolution, and final closure.
   - Tracks report lifecycle through 7 distinct states (Pending_Validation, Community_Rejected, Open, Pending_Rejection_Review, Pending_Verification, Closed, Reopened).
   
3. **Accountability Loops:** Implementing mandatory community voting phases that prevent authorities from arbitrarily dismissing valid issues and requiring community verification before an issue can be marked as officially closed.
   - Community voting gates all state transitions, ensuring no single authority can unilaterally control outcomes.

## 2. Design Principles & Architecture

This contract is designed based on the following principles derived from the project proposal:

* **Separation of Concerns:** The contract does not store large media files. It only stores small, fixed-size data (hashes, status codes, counters). Heavy data resides on IPFS.
* **Privacy-First:** The contract never handles citizen personally identifiable information (PII). It interacts solely with ZKP Nullifier hashes provided by the trusted backend relayer to ensure uniqueness without revealing identity.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** It utilizes OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` to strictly define what actions the Backend Relayer and the designated Authority Nodes (Gov/NGO) can perform.

### 2.1. Service Architecture & Dependencies

The smart contract is the final component in a multi-stage validation pipeline:

| Service | Purpose | Output | Downstream |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AiOracleService** | Content moderation & spam detection | `isApproved: boolean` | IpfsService (only if approved) |
| **IpfsService** | Distributed storage for evidence | `ipfsCID: string` | BlockchainService |
| **BlockchainService** | Blockchain submission wrapper | `transactionHash: string` | Reporting.sol (via RELAYER_ROLE) |
| **Reporting.sol** | Immutable ledger & FSM enforcement | `reportId: uint256` | Community voting & authority actions |

**Gateway Pattern:** Each service acts as a gate to the next:
- Reports rejected by AiOracleService NEVER reach IPFS.
- Reports not on IPFS NEVER reach the blockchain.
- Reports not on the blockchain NEVER enter the community voting phase.

## 3. Roles and Permissions

The contract will manage the following roles:

| Role Constant | Description | Assigned To | Key Permissions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` | The supreme administrative role. | Deployer address (e.g., Node 1 boot address). | Granting/revoking other roles. |
| `RELAYER_ROLE` | Trusted intermediary for citizens without wallets. | The public address of the NestJS Backend Server wallet. | Calling `createReport()`. |
| `AUTHORITY_ROLE` | Officially recognized governance entities. | Public addresses of Local Gov Node and NGO Node. | Calling `markAsSolved()` and `rejectIssue()`. |

*Note: Ordinary citizens do not have a role assigned in the contract. They interact via the Relayer, and their "permission" to act is validated cryptographically via ZKP nullifiers.*

## 4. Data Structures

### 4.1. Enums (State Definitions)

Represents the current stage of a report in its lifecycle.

```solidity
enum ReportStatus {
    Pending_Validation,       // 0: Just submitted, waiting for community check
    Community_Rejected,       // 1: Community voted it down as spam/fake (Terminal)
    Open,                     // 2: Validated, waiting for authority action
    Pending_Rejection_Review, // 3: Authority rejected it, community must confirm/appeal
    Pending_Verification,     // 4: Authority claims fixed, community must verify
    Closed,                   // 5: Successfully resolved or confirmed rejected (Terminal)
    Reopened                  // 6: Community rejected the fix, sent back to authority
}

```

### 4.2. Main Struct

The core data object for a single issue report.

```solidity
struct Report {
    uint256 id;                  // Unique sequential ID
    string ipfsCID;              // IPFS Hash pointing to off-chain image/text data
    bytes32 submissionNullifier; // ZKP hash used to create report (prevents double submission)
    ReportStatus status;         // Current state in the FSM
    uint256 createdAt;           // Timestamp of block creation
    address actionedBy;          // Address of authority who last acted (solved/rejected)
    
    // Voting Counters (Reset depending on phase)
    
    // Voting Counters (Reset depending on phase)
    uint256 votesFor;            // Generic counter for "True", "Solved", or "Uphold Rejection"
    uint256 votesAgainst;        // Generic counter for "False", "Not Solved", or "Appeal"
    
    // Workflow Protection Fields (EDGE CASE MITIGATIONS)
    uint256 reopenCount;         // Tracks number of times report was reopened (prevents infinite loops - EDGE CASE 2)
    uint256 expiresAt;           // Timestamp when report expires due to stalling (prevents limbo states - EDGE CASE 3)
}

```

### 4.3. State Mappings

| Mapping Definition | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `mapping(uint256 => Report) public reports;` | Main storage, maps Report ID to its data struct. |
| `mapping(bytes32 => bool) public submissionNullifiers;` | Tracks used submission nullifiers to prevent a citizen from creating the same report twice. |
| `mapping(uint256 => mapping(bytes32 => bool)) public reportVotes;` | **Crucial for Sybil Resistance during voting.** Maps `[ReportID][VotingNullifier] => hasVoted`. Prevents a citizen from voting multiple times on the same report in a single phase. |

## 5. State Transition Diagram

The contract implements the following Finite State Machine. All function calls must adhere to the transitions defined here.

*(Note: This image is the one generated in the previous step based on our finalized architecture.)*

## 6. Functional Specification

### 6.1. Configuration & Constants

The contract will have hardcoded thresholds (which could be made governable later) to determine transition triggers.

* `VALIDATION_THRESHOLD`: Votes needed to move from Pending to Open.
* `REJECTION_THRESHOLD`: Votes needed to move from Pending to Community_Rejected.
* `VERIFICATION_THRESHOLD`: Votes needed to move from Pending_Verification to Closed.
* `REOPEN_THRESHOLD`: Votes needed to move from Pending_Verification to Reopened.
* `APPEAL_THRESHOLD`: Votes needed to overturn an authority rejection.

**Workflow Protection Constants (EDGE CASE MITIGATIONS):**

* `REOPEN_LIMIT` (default: 3): Maximum number of times a report can be reopened in its lifecycle. Prevents infinite reopen loops (EDGE CASE 2). When exceeded, the report is forcibly closed via community vote consensus.
* `EXPIRATION_TIMEOUT` (default: 7 days): Time window during which a report can accumulate votes. Reports that remain in voting states (Pending_Validation, Pending_Rejection_Review, or Pending_Verification) beyond this timeout become expired and no longer accept votes, preventing indefinite report stalling (EDGE CASE 3).

### 6.2. External Functions

#### `createReport(string memory _ipfsCID, bytes32 _submissionNullifier)`

* **Caller Chain:** ReportingController → BlockchainService → Reporting.sol
* **Pre-requisites:** 
  1. Content MUST be approved by AiOracleService
  2. Content MUST be uploaded to IPFS and return a valid CID
  3. Only then can BlockchainService call this function

* **Role:** `RELAYER_ROLE` only.
* **Pre-conditions:**
  * `_submissionNullifier` must not exist in `submissionNullifiers` mapping.
  * `_ipfsCID` must be a valid IPFS hash (provided by IpfsService).

* **Logic:**
  1. Mark `_submissionNullifier` as used.
  2. Increment `nextReportId`.
  3. Create new `Report` struct with status `Pending_Validation`.
  4. Emit `ReportCreated` event.

* **Post-event:** The report is now on-chain and enters the community validation phase.



#### `voteOnReport(uint256 _reportId, bool _voteDirection, bytes32 _votingNullifier, VotingPhase _phase)`

* **Role:** Public (callable by Relayer on behalf of citizen).
* **Pre-conditions:**
* Report must exist.
* Report must be in a votable state corresponding to the `_phase` (e.g., `Pending_Validation`, `Pending_Verification`, or `Pending_Rejection_Review`).
* `_votingNullifier` must not have voted on this `_reportId` before.


* **Logic:**
1. Mark `reportVotes[_reportId][_votingNullifier]` as true.
2. Increment `votesFor` or `votesAgainst` based on `_voteDirection`.
3. **Check Thresholds:** If thresholds are met based on current state, trigger status transition (e.g., `Pending_Validation` -> `Open`).
4. Emit `VoteCast` and potentially `StatusChanged` events.



#### `markAsSolved(uint256 _reportId)`

* **Role:** `AUTHORITY_ROLE` only.
* **Pre-conditions:** Report status must be `Open` OR `Reopened`.
* **Logic:**
1. Update status to `Pending_Verification`.
2. Set `actionedBy` to `msg.sender`.
3. Reset voting counters to zero for the next phase.
4. Emit `StatusChanged` event.



#### `rejectIssue(uint256 _reportId)`

* **Role:** `AUTHORITY_ROLE` only.
* **Pre-conditions:** Report status must be `Open`.
* **Logic:**
1. Update status to `Pending_Rejection_Review`.
2. Set `actionedBy` to `msg.sender`.
3. Reset voting counters to zero for appeal phase.
4. Emit `StatusChanged` event.



## 7. Events

The contract will emit events to allow off-chain systems (NestJS backend and Next.js frontend) to index data and update UIs in real-time.

```solidity
event ReportCreated(uint256 indexed reportId, string ipfsCID, uint256 timestamp);

event StatusChanged(
    uint256 indexed reportId, 
    ReportStatus oldStatus, 
    ReportStatus newStatus, 
    address indexed changedBy
);

event VoteCast(
    uint256 indexed reportId, 
    bool voteDirection, 
    ReportStatus currentStatus
);

```

## 8. Edge Case Mitigations & Security Considerations

This section documents identified vulnerabilities from the test suite and their implemented solutions.

### EDGE CASE 1: Phase-Based Sybil Resistance

**Vulnerability:** Without proper phase scoping, a citizen could theoretically vote multiple times on the same report if tracking is not phase-aware.

**Mitigation:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Voting nullifier tracking is properly scoped by phase: `reportVotes[reportId][phase][nullifier]`
- Prevents the same nullifier from voting twice on the same report within the same phase
- Allows the same citizen to vote in different phases (Validation, Rejection_Review, Verification) with different voting nullifiers
- Test: EDGE CASE 1.1 & 1.2 verify phase-based vote tracking is functional

### EDGE CASE 2: Infinite Reopening Loops

**Vulnerability:** Without a reopening counter, authorities and communities could indefinitely reopen a report in a cycle, causing workflow deadlock.

**Mitigation:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Added `reopenCount` field to `Report` struct to track the number of times a report has been reopened
- Added `REOPEN_LIMIT` constant (default: 3) to cap maximum reopenings per report
- Logic: When `reopenCount >= REOPEN_LIMIT` and community votes to reopen, the report is forcibly closed instead
- Prevents infinite loops while still allowing reasonable community appeals
- Test: EDGE CASE 2.1 & 2.2 verify reopen counter prevents infinite cycles

### EDGE CASE 3: Stalled Reports & Limbo States

**Vulnerability:** Reports stuck in voting states (with insufficient votes) could accumulate indefinitely, consuming storage and state overhead.

**Mitigation:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Added `expiresAt` timestamp field to `Report` struct
- Added `EXPIRATION_TIMEOUT` constant (default: 7 days) to set a voting window
- All reports automatically expire 7 days after creation
- Voting is explicitly blocked on expired reports: `require(block.timestamp <= report.expiresAt, "Report has expired")`
- Expired reports remain queryable for archival purposes but no longer accept community input
- Recommended: Off-chain indexer can flag expired reports in the UI for cleanup or authority decision-making
- Test: EDGE CASE 3.1 & 3.2 document the stalling prevention mechanism

### EDGE CASE 4: Relayer Centralization Risk

**Documentation:** The contract requires the `RELAYER_ROLE` (typically a NestJS backend wallet) to:
- Submit all citizen-initiated reports
- Relay all citizen voting transactions

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Maintain role-based access control via OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl`
- Regularly audit relayer wallet activity and transaction patterns
- Consider multi-signature relayer setup in production for enhanced security
- Implement time-locks or governance approvals for sensitive operations
- Test: EDGE CASE 4.1 documents the centralization risk boundary

### EDGE CASE 5: Nullifier Reuse & Immutability

**Vulnerability:** If a citizen submits a report with a typo or incorrect content, they cannot resubmit with corrected content using the same nullifier.

**Mitigation & Design Rationale:**
- Submission nullifiers are intentionally immutable and one-time use
- Users are encouraged to use epoch-based nullifiers (user_id + epoch_period) rather than report-specific identifiers
- Allows users to submit one corrected report in a new epoch, but prevents duplicate reports
- Off-chain relayer can provide guidance on how to generate epoch-based nullifiers for better UX
- Test: EDGE CASE 5.1 & 5.2 verify nullifier immutability and epoch-based design

### EDGE CASE 6: Threshold Race Conditions

**Vulnerability:** Over-voting scenarios (votes exceeding threshold) could cause transaction ordering issues.

**Mitigation:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- State transition checks (`require(report.status == ReportStatus.Pending_Validation, ...)`) prevent voting on status-mismatched phases
- Once threshold is reached and status transitions, further votes on that phase naturally fail (correct behavior)
- Prevents vote overshoots by gating based on current report status
- Test: EDGE CASE 6.1 & 6.2 verify vote counting at threshold boundaries

### EDGE CASE 7: Data Structure & Storage Optimization

**Current Design:** IPFS CIDs are stored as `string` type for human readability and dynamic length support.

**Gas Considerations:**
- `string` storage is less efficient than `bytes32` or `bytes` alternatives
- Trade-off: Readability and flexibility vs. gas cost per report creation
- `string` chosen for: on-chain reference completeness and off-chain system compatibility
- Future optimization: Consider storing only the hash suffix (last 20 bytes) to reduce storage

**Alternative Optimization (Not Currently Implemented):**
```solidity
bytes32 public ipfsCIDHash;  // Keccak256 hash of IPFS CID - saves storage, requires off-chain lookup
```

- Test: EDGE CASE 7.1 & 7.2 document current storage approach and struct overhead

## 9. Testing & Validation Strategy

All identified edge cases have corresponding unit tests in `test/Reporting.ts`:
- **Standard Path Tests:** Validate core functionality (creation, transitions, authority actions)
- **Edge Case Tests:** Cover 7 distinct vulnerability categories with 18+ test cases
- All tests passing indicates correct implementation of FSM and voting logic
